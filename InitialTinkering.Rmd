## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
set.seed(0603)
xaxis = c(rnorm(256,100,40),rnorm(256,400,40))

x = data.frame(xaxis,rnorm(512,256,80))
plot(x,xlim=c(0,512), ylim=c(0,512), main='Custom Axes')
head(x)

#Wrong idea

```




```{r}
#Essential package
library(spectralGP)
set.seed(15)
gp=gp(c(512,512),matern.specdens,c(1,1))
gp2 = gp(c(512,512),matern.specdens,c(.5,1)) #This is simplest form of counfounding layer I believe.
simulate(gp)
simulate(gp2) 
plot(gp) #intended input
plot(gp2) #added counfounding to input
#How to combine two gp's?? // How to fiddle with the settings of the gp acurately. 
#How to view the individual value at each point.
#Matern.specdens specifics?




    
    
    

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
