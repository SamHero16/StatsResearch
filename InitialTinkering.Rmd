## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
set.seed(0603)
xaxis = c(rnorm(256,100,40),rnorm(256,400,40))

x = data.frame(xaxis,rnorm(512,256,80))
plot(x,xlim=c(0,512), ylim=c(0,512), main='Custom Axes')
head(x)

#Wrong idea

```

```{r}
#non spatial representation of idea/tinkering around more

set.seed(100)
confounding = rnorm(100,0,1)
x = runif(100, 0, 1) +confounding
y = 3*x +  rnorm(100,0,1) +confounding
plot(x,y)
summary(lm(y~x+confounding))
abline(0.0380,2.93484)

#see heavy correlation that is not actually there.

```


```{r}
#Essential package
library(spectralGP)
set.seed(15)
gp=gp(c(512,512),matern.specdens,c(.1,2))
confounder = gp(c(512,512),matern.specdens,c(.15,2)) #This is simplest form of counfounding layer I believe.
altconfounder = gp(c(512,512),matern.specdens,c(.5,1))
simulate(gp)
simulate(confounder) 
simulate(altconfounder) 
plot(gp) #intended input
plot(confounder)
plot(altconfounder)#added counfounding to input
#How to combine two gp's?? // How to fiddle with the settings of the gp acurately. 
#How to view the individual value at each point.
#Matern.specdens specifics?
```


```{r}
#Actual Sim beginnings. 

#Without Confounder

x = gp[["process"]]
y = x + rnorm(262144,0,1)

model1 = lm(y~x)
plot(x,y,xlim=c(-4,4), ylim=c(-7,7))

abline(model1[["coefficients"]][["(Intercept)"]],model1[["coefficients"]][["x"]],col = "red",main = "Without Confounding")
title(main = "Without Confounding Added")

#########
##With counfounder

x2 = gp[["process"]] + .5*altconfounder[["process"]]
y2 = x2 + .5*altconfounder[["process"]] + rnorm(262144,0,1)

model2 = lm(y2~x2)
##model2wc = lm(y2~x2+confounder[["process"]])
plot(x2,y2,xlim=c(-4,4), ylim=c(-7,7))
##abline(model2wc[["coefficients"]][["(Intercept)"]],model2wc[["coefficients"]][["x2"]],col = "red")
##summary(model2wc)

abline(model2[["coefficients"]][["(Intercept)"]],model2[["coefficients"]][["x2"]],col = "blue")
title(main = "With Confounding Added")

model1
model2


#Notice: Error is no longer normally distributed along x ??

#***FIND CORRELATION THAT IS NOT DUE TO CONFOUNDING. THAT MOVEMENT IN THE LINE IS DUE TO COUNFOUNDING, WANT TO MINIMIZE IT.
#*but the same issue happens when we have to different 'confoundings'
    
    

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
